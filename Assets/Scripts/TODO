    - effects for spells
    - Add summoning for enemy
        - maybe spells too at this point, later if not
    - Trap cards / reaction

working on:     - Enemy Summoning


Last session you: Did work on card attacking, but didnt test it at all really
                    Also laid groundwork for attack animations / coroutines
                    Just check commit

So next session: Test & debug. Both card attacking & temp stats should be working.






Known Bugs:
    - Position is wrong for cards in hand - and it really needs refactoring current logic is bad
