                Add enemy summoning - simple version. Play first affordable mon in hand
                Add enemy attacking - simple version. If a mon is summoned, attack random between player mons, player if no mons


Known Bugs:
    - Attacking is broken some of the time
    - Large text has the turn text as:
            Pierre
            's turn
    - Card components intersect with one another
    - Position is wrong for cards in hand - and it really needs refactoring current logic is bad
        - Refactor card.getHandSpace() 
        - Cards should be children of the hand gameobject
        - Cards should use sorting layers instead of Z values to handle overlapping
